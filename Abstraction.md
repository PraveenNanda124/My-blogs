# Abstraction

![a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116082827/235210900-22d52098-bf2f-4893-b9ce-e88645d62a36.jpeg)


Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential features while ignoring irrelevant details. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through classes and interfaces. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an interface defines a set of methods that a class must implement.



Here's an example of a class in Python:





class Animal:

    def __init__(self, name, species):

        self.name = name

        self.species = species



    def speak(self):

        pass

In this example, we define a class called Animal. The __init__ method is a constructor that initializes the object's name and species attributes. The speak method is empty, representing a common behavior of all animals.
