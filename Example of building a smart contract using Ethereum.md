Create an Ethereum wallet and obtain some Ether, the cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum network.

Write a smart contract using a language such as Solidity, which defines the rules and logic of the contract.

Compile the contract code using a tool such as Remix or Truffle.

Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network using a tool such as MetaMask or Geth.

Interact with the contract using a dApp or a tool such as MyEtherWallet.
