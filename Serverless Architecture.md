# Serverless Architecture

![s](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116082827/235378669-551b453c-ae31-4049-b77c-9b6a66e7bd58.png)


Serverless architecture is an approach to building web applications that doesn't require managing servers or infrastructure. Instead, developers can focus on writing code and deploying it to a cloud-based platform like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions. These platforms allow developers to run code in response to events (like HTTP requests), and they automatically scale the infrastructure as needed. Here's an example of using AWS Lambda to create a serverless API:





exports.handler = async (event) => {

  const { name } = JSON.parse(event.body);



  return {

    statusCode: 200,

    body: JSON.stringify({ message: `Hello, ${name}!` }),

  };

};

In this code, we're using AWS Lambda to create a serverless API that returns a greeting message. We're using the exports.handler function to define the code that should run in response to an HTTP request. We're parsing the name parameter from the request body, and we're returning a JSON response with a greeting message.
