Agile methodology is a project management methodology that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration. It involves breaking a project into small, manageable pieces and iterating on each piece until it is complete.

Example using Scrum framework:





from scrum import Sprint, BacklogItem, Task, UserStory



user_story = UserStory("As a user, I want to be able to log in so that I can access my account.")

backlog_item = BacklogItem(user_story)

sprint = Sprint(backlog_items=[backlog_item])



task_1 = Task("Implement login form")

task_2 = Task("Add authentication logic")

backlog_item.tasks = [task_1, task_2]



sprint.start()
