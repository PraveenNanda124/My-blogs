# Internet of Things (IoT)

IoT involves connecting physical devices, sensors, and other objects to the internet to gather and transmit data. It typically involves using IoT platforms such as AWS IoT, Microsoft Azure IoT, or Google Cloud IoT to manage and analyze IoT data.

Example of connecting a Raspberry Pi to AWS IoT using Python:



Set up an AWS IoT thing, certificate, and policy.

Install the AWS IoT Python SDK on the Raspberry Pi.

Write a Python script to read sensor data and publish it to AWS IoT using the SDK.

Create AWS Lambda functions to process and analyze the IoT data.

Set up AWS IoT Rules to trigger Lambda functions based on the incoming data.

I hope these examples help you understand how software engineering topics can be applied to coding tasks. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
