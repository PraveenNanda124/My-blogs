Big Data involves the processing and analysis of large and complex data sets using tools like Hadoop and Spark. As a software engineer, you'll need to be familiar with concepts like data warehousing, data mining, and data visualization, as well as tools like SQL and Tableau. Here's an example of a simple Spark program written in Scala that counts the number of occurrences of each word in a text file:



import org.apache.spark.SparkContext

import org.apache.spark.SparkConf



object WordCount {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {

    val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("Word Count")

    val sc = new SparkContext(conf)



    val textFile = sc.textFile("hdfs://input.txt")

    val wordCounts = textFile.flatMap(line => line.split(" "))

      .map(word => (word, 1))

      .reduceByKey(_ + _)



    wordCounts.saveAsTextFile("hdfs://output")

  }

}
