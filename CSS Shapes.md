# CSS Shapes

CSS Shapes allow you to define custom shapes for your elements, which can be used for text wrapping or creating unique layouts. Here's an example:



.shape {

  shape-outside: circle(50%);

  float: left;

  margin: 20px;

}

In this code, we have an image with a circular shape defined by the shape-outside property. We also use the float property to position the image to the left and the margin property to add some spacing.
