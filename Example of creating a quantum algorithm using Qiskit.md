Set up a local development environment and install Qiskit, an open-source quantum computing framework.

Create a quantum circuit using Qiskit's Python API and add quantum gates to perform quantum operations on qubits.

Use Qiskit's simulator to simulate the behavior of the quantum circuit and analyze the results.

Use IBM Q Experience, a cloud-based quantum computing platform, to run the quantum circuit on actual quantum hardware.
