 HTML Imports



HTML imports allow you to import HTML files into other HTML files, similar to how modules work in JavaScript. This can help you organize your HTML code and reuse common components across multiple projects. HTML imports are deprecated and are being replaced by the import statement in JavaScript modules.

Here's an example of how to use HTML imports:





<head>

  <link rel="import" href="my-component.html">

</head>

<body>

  <my-component></my-component>

</body>
