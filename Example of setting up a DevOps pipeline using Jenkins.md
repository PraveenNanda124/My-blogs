Install and configure Jenkins on a server.



Create a Jenkins pipeline using a Jenkinsfile that defines the stages of the pipeline, such as build, test, and deploy.



Use Jenkins plugins to integrate with other tools, such as GitHub for source control, SonarQube for code quality analysis, or Docker for containerization.



Configure Jenkins to automatically trigger the pipeline when changes are pushed to the source code repository.



# Internet of Things (IoT):

IoT involves connecting everyday objects and devices to the internet, allowing them to collect and share data in real-time. It typically involves using IoT platforms such as AWS IoT or Google Cloud IoT to develop IoT applications.
