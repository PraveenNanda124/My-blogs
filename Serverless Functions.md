# Serverless Functions

![s](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116082827/235351568-d7050526-e2e5-4ac5-93b6-49d6df2d9491.png)


Serverless functions allow developers to run code without managing servers or infrastructure. Serverless functions can be used for a variety of purposes, including handling webhooks, processing form submissions, and triggering notifications. Here's an example of using AWS Lambda to create a basic serverless function:





exports.handler = async function(event, context) {

  console.log('Hello, world!');

  return {

    statusCode: 200,

    body: 'Hello, world!'

  };

};

In this code, we're using the exports.handler syntax to define a function that will be executed when the serverless function is triggered. We're logging a message to the console and returning a simple response with a 200 status code and a "Hello, world!" message in the body.
