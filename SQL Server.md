 #SQL Server



SQL Server is a relational database management system created by Microsoft. Developers can use SQL Server to store and retrieve data for their applications. SQL Server supports the SQL language for querying and manipulating data. Developers can also use various programming languages such as C#, Java, and Python to interact with SQL Server. Here's an example of code in C# to query a SQL Server database:



using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))

{

    SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM MyTable", connection);

    connection.Open();

    SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();

    while (reader.Read())

    {

        Console.WriteLine(reader["ColumnName"].ToString());

    }

}
