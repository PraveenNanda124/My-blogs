Cloud computing involves delivering computing services over the internet, such as storage, processing, and networking. Understanding cloud computing is essential for developing software that can run on cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Here's an example of a simple cloud application in Python using the AWS Lambda service:



import json



def lambda_handler(event, context):

    # Extract the message from the event

    message = event['message']

    

    # Print the message

    print('Received message:', message)

    

    # Construct a response

    response = {

        'statusCode': 200,

        'body': json.dumps({'message': message})

    }

    

    return response
