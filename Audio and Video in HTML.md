HTML provides built-in support for playing audio and video files using the <audio> and <video> elements. You can specify the source file using the src attribute and add various attributes to control playback, such as autoplay, loop, and controls.

Here's an example of how to embed a video in your HTML code:





// <video src="my-video.mp4" controls></video>

These are just a few more examples of newer topics in HTML. As HTML continues to evolve, new features and APIs will be added to make it even more powerful and versatile.
