Scrum is an Agile framework for managing and completing complex projects. It involves breaking down the project into small, manageable tasks and completing them in short iterations called sprints. The team meets daily for a quick stand-up meeting to discuss progress and plan for the day.

Sample code snippet for Scrum:





public class Sprint {

    private List<Task> tasks;

    private Date startDate;

    private Date endDate;

    private String sprintGoal;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters

}

public class Task {

    private String name;

    private String description;

    private int estimatedTime;

    private int remainingTime;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters

}

public class ScrumTeam {

    private List<Sprint> sprints;

    private List<TeamMember> teamMembers;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters

}
