# Static Type Checkers

Static type checkers are tools that analyze JavaScript code to detect and prevent type-related errors at compile time. By enforcing type safety, static type checkers can help developers write more reliable and maintainable code. Some popular static type checkers for JavaScript include TypeScript and Flow. Here's an example of using TypeScript to define a function with explicit types:



function multiply(a: number, b: number): number {

  return a * b;

}



const result = multiply(2, 3);

console.log(result);

In this code, we're using TypeScript to define a function called multiply that takes two parameters of type number and returns a value of type number. We're then using this function to multiply the numbers 2 and 3 and log the result to the console. If we were to pass non-numeric values to this function, TypeScript would generate a type error at compile time.
