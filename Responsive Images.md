Responsive images are images that adjust their size and resolution based on the device they're being viewed on. This can help improve the user experience by reducing page load times and data usage. The <picture> element and the srcset and sizes attributes are used to create responsive images.

Here's an example of how to use the <picture> element to create a responsive image:



#<picture>

  <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="large-image.jpg">

  <source media="(min-width: 600px)" srcset="medium-image.jpg">

  <img src="small-image.jpg" alt="A small image">

#</picture>
