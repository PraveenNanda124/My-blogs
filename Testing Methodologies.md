Testing is a critical part of software engineering. You'll need to know how to write unit tests, integration tests, and other types of tests to ensure that your code works correctly. Some popular testing frameworks include JUnit (for Java), pytest (for Python), and Mocha (for JavaScript). Here's an example of a simple unit test in pytest:



def test_addition():

    assert 1 + 1 == 2

These are just a few examples of the many topics that software engineers need to know. As a software engineer, it's important to continually learn and stay up-to-date on new technologies and best practices.
