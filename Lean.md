Lean is an Agile methodology that focuses on minimizing waste and maximizing value. It involves continuous improvement and streamlining processes. The team uses a feedback loop to continuously evaluate and improve their work.

Sample code snippet for Lean:





public class ValueStream {

    private List<ProcessStep> processSteps;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters

}

public class ProcessStep {

    private String name;

    private int cycleTime;

    private int leadTime;

    private int percentComplete;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters

}

public class FeedbackLoop {

    private List<Feedback> feedbackItems;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters

}

public class Feedback {

    private String description;

    private boolean implemented;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters

}
