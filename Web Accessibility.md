Web accessibility is the practice of designing and developing websites and applications that are accessible to people with disabilities. This includes people with visual impairments, hearing impairments, cognitive impairments, and physical disabilities. Web accessibility is essential for ensuring that everyone has equal access to information and services on the web.



There are several best practices for web accessibility, including:



Providing alternative text for images and other non-text content

Using descriptive headings and labels to organize content

Providing captions and transcripts for audio and video content

Ensuring that color is not the only means of conveying information

Ensuring that keyboard navigation is available and easy to use

Using semantic HTML markup to enhance accessibility

Here's an example of how to provide alternative text for an image:





<img src="example.jpg" alt="A woman using a wheelchair at a museum exhibit">

In this code, we're using the alt attribute to provide alternative text for an image. The alternative text describes the content of the image, making it accessible to people with visual impairments who use screen readers.



Web accessibility is an essential consideration for all web developers. By following best practices for web accessibility, developers can ensure that their websites and applications are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities.
